                I was born in Debrecen, went to university and worked in
                Budapest and studied in Copenhagen. I came to Berlin to do an
                Erasmus+ semester and learn fluent German, but fell in love with
                the city and all its people, so I decided to stay and build a
                career here. I love traveling around Europe, reading, and
                meeting people from all around the world.
              </p>
              <p>
                During my early academic education, I realized I had a deep
                interest in creating websites and web applications, so I decided
                to pursue a Software Developer career. I specialize in
                Javascript and Typescript (both in Backend and Frontend), but I
                also have academic and professional experience with other
                languages and tools like Python or Java.
              </p>
              <p>
                My goal is to gain relevant professional experience in every
                aspect of Web Development. I'm hoping to experience all roles
                required to develop and maintain a Web Application, so that one
                day I can start my own startup and create something truly
                unique, that helps others.
