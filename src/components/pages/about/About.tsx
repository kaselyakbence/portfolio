              I was born in Debrecen, went to university and worked in Budapest
              and studied in Copenhagen. I came to Berlin to do an Erasmus+
              semester and learn fluent German, but fell in love with the city
              and all its people, so I decided to stay and build a career here.
              I love traveling around Europe, reading, and meeting people from
              all around the world.

              My goal is to gain relevant professional experience in every
              aspect of Web Development. I'm hoping to experience all roles
              required to develop and maintain a Web Application, so that one
              day I can start my own startup and create something truly unique,
              that helps others.

              I started my professional career as a Frontend Developer Trainee
              at MOHAnet Mobilsystem, a startup located in Budapest developing
              remote management and big data systems. As a trainee, I learned
              how to use my previously acquired knowledge to take part in
              developing a web application for data visualization and
              administration of data-collecting devices.
            </li>
            <li>
              After finishing my Bachelor's I started working full-time at
              MOHAnet as a Frontend Developer. During my work, I was able to
              experience the whole software development cycle, from designing
              software to releasing it. I learned how to integrate code into an
              already existing codebase and create reusable libraries for
              in-company use.

              I finished my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at ELTE, which
              is Hunagry's best university for this course. Here I decided to
              focus my studies on Software Development and I learned the basics
              of building, maintaining, developing, and applying
              software-oriented technological tools and systems alone or in
              teamwork.

              I later spent a year at the University of Copenhagen, where I
              further developed my reasoning and problem-solving skills, as well
              as deepened my understanding of algorithms, data structures, and
              programming language theory. I earned relevant experience in
              completing projects in an English-speaking academic setting.
